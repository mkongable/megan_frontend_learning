            <h3>Design Requirements</h3>
            <p>
                The design requirements for this project were to create a robot that could complete the following tasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Compact down into a 4'x4'x4' box</li>
                    <li>Weigh less than 120 lbs.</li>
                    <li>Handle slopes of 30 degrees</li>
                    <li>Have a turning radius of less than 10 ft.</li>
                    <li>Have a clearance greater than 12 in.</li>
                    <li>Be pedaled by two riders</li>
                    <li>Be able to complete an obstacle course, as shown in the picture</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Initial Ideas</h3>
            <p>To begin, my team met to brainstorm. We had to determine if the rover was going to have:
                <ul>
                    <li>Three wheels or four wheels</li>
                    <li>Single or multiple beams</li>
                    <li>Three spokes or five spokes</li>
                    <li>Both seats forward or back-to-back</li>
                    <li>Chain drivetrain or belt drivetrain</li>
                </ul>
                We decided on a four-wheeled tri-beam rover with back-to-back seating and a belt drivetrain. The wheels ended up being
                4-spoked. We decided to use aluminum to lower the weight of the rover.

            <h3>CAD Designs</h3>
            <p>The next step was to create CAD models and engineering drawings of the pieces of the rover. The models were used to run stress tests
                and the size of the beams and supports were adjusted accordingly.

        </div>
        <div class = "right-col-4">
            <h3>Construction</h3>
            <p> After the CAD models were finalized, we began to construct the rover. We had a professional weld the frame together, and then we
                added the suspension, wheels, and other components. We also added a hinge and clasp in the center of the frame to allow the rover
                to fold up into a 4'x 4'x 4' box.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> The rover design was adjusted throughout the construction process. We had to change the suspension to reduce the turning radius
                and prevent the support rods from slipping out of the socket. We also had to adapt when the belt we had selected for the drivetrain
                was on backorder and the deadline was rapidly approaching. We ended up using a smaller width belt which withstood the predicted 
                stress in the ANSYS stress tests, but had a lower safety factor.

            <h3>Outreach</h3>
            <p> Part of the competition was to visit schools and teach students about the rover and the engineering process. I took charge of the
                outreach portion of the project. I reached out to 10 6th-8th grade teachers in the fargo area. When all of them responsed positively,
                I met with them to determine times to visit their classrooms. Having so many classes to visit, I began coordinating with the other 3
                senior design teams and SWE to find enough volunteers to visit all of the classes. We ended up interacting with 1000 students teaching
                them about writing clear instructions, communication, teamwork and the engineering process.

            <h3>Final Product</h3>
            <p> Since the trip to Huntsville, AL was cancelled due to COVID, we were unable to compete in the in-person competition. However,
                we built a shortened version of the obstacle course and recorded a video of us driving the rover through it. The rover sucessfully
                made it through 75% of the obstacles. We also submitted a final report to the NASA HERC commitee. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Throughout the project, I learned how to work in a team with people who have different work styles than me, how to adapt when issues
                arise, and how to sucessfully complete a project from start to finish. If the project were to be redone, I would have been more 
                persistent when needing items from the teacher and the sponsors. I also would have ordered spare belts since ours stretched too far
                after one run. I had an amazing time learning about the design process and working with my team. I am so grateful for the opportunity
                to be a part of this project!
