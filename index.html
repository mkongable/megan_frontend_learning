					<h2>About Me</h2>
						<p>Hello! My name is Megan Kongable! I am a recent mechanical engineering graduate from North Dakota who is currently pursuing my master’s
							 degree in plastics engineering and a computer science certificate from University of Massachusetts Lowell! In high school, I attended an 
							 introduce a girl to engineering day that opened my eyes to the possibilities that become available with an engineering degree. </p>
						<p>I began my journey into engineering in the mechanical engineering discipline focusing on polymers and coatings. I adored my coatings classes 
							and realized that I wanted to dive deeper into plastics engineering, specifically bio-based and biodegradable plastics. </p>
						<p>During COVID, I began to teach myself how to code. Starting with Java, I used Hackerrank and Leetcode to learn the syntax and how to put my 
							thoughts into a clear solution. From there, with the help of a friend, I learned OOP design principles and expanded my knowledge of data 
							structures. Currently, I am proficient in Java, Python, and C++.</p>
						<p>When I’m not in school or learning to code, I enjoy playing with my pets, watching movies with my friends, and exploring new places. I have 
							two cats: Penelope and Vivienne, <em>and have been known to rescue stray kittens</em>. I’m a huge sci-fi fan and my best friend and I have watched <em>Lost 
							In Space</em>, <em>The Expanse</em>, a bunch of the <em>StarWars</em> series, and both <em>Stargate</em> series! We are currently bingeing <em>The Orville</em> 
							in our free time! I love travelling, especially to places that have a science museum and a zoo, and learning about the history of an area. I enjoy hiking 
							and my photos page on this website has just a few of the photos I’ve taken!</p>
						<p>Thank you for checking out my website! Feel free to contact me if you have any questions! I am currently seeking a <Strong>mechanical or 
							software engineering role</Strong> in the Austin, TX area or remotely!</p>
